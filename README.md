#RSSMAP:

##This project was created in Computer Science 323. It is an application where the user can subscribe to an RSS feed and organize each article on their liking. There is three main interfaces where the user can do this.

##Our group won Best Feature Award with my implementation of using SpeechRecognizer from the Speech library from .NET. It only has the commands: add channel, add feed, select article, next article, previous article, read article, unread article, and exit.

###The main interface provides a nice easy way to put feeds into collections in a treeview and when he/she clicks on the feed, it will display each article and whether or not they read it. If they click on an article it will open the web browser component and display it for you to read.

###The topic interface allows a user to make a collection and give it keywords like sports, NFL, and hockey; then it will search through all of the users feeds and only return the ones with the keywords.

###The map interface gives a geolocation of each article by showing a pushpin on BING Maps. When the user clicks the pushpin, it will bring them back to the main interface to read the article.
